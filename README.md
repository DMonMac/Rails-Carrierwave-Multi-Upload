This allows uploading multiple images using carrierwave.

### Thanks
 - Thanks to this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21411988/rails-4-multiple-image-or-file-upload-using-carrierwave) in stackoverflow, I was able to create this.
 - That answer also provides a working demo of the app, which I'm going to post [here](https://github.com/savanr/rails-carrierwave-multiple-attachment) as well.

### Run App
1. In your terminal, run `git clone git@github.com:DMonMac/Rails-Carrierwave-Multi-Upload.git`

2. Run the following commands in this order:
    ```
    cd Rails-Carrierwave-Multi-Upload
    bundle
    rake db:migrate
    rails s
    ```

3. In your browser, open http://localhost:3000/
